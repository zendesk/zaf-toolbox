If youâ€™re interested in helping us enhance this toolbox, your input and collaboration are greatly appreciated.

## Getting started

## Installation

### Requirements

- Node 18 or higher
- Add the package into a [ZAF application](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/)

#### Sunshine Conversation Api Service configuration

To build the `authorizationToken`, you can use the following command:

```bash
echo -n "<your-api-key-id>:<your-api-secret-key>" | base64
```

A tool has been developed to help you generate this token, follow this [link](https://zendesklabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/p/sunco-token-generator)

### Install the package

This package is deployed using GitHub Packages, to install it you will need to follow
this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

Here is a TL;DR; version of the installation guide:

1. Create a personal GitHub access token (classic) with the `read:packages` permission
2. Using GitHub interface, allow the token to be used on Zendesk organizations (_Configure SSO_ button)
3. On your terminal, execute:
    ```shell
    npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
    ```
    The username to use is your GitHub username, the password is the token created at step 1
4. If you need to install any `@zendesk` npm packages (i.e. `@zendesk/zcli`), do it now
5. Create a `.npmrc` file at the root of your repository and copy the following on it: `@zendesk:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`
6. Execute the following command:
    ```shell
    npm i @zendesk/zaf-toolbox
    ```

For more information on package installing through GitHub packages,
see "[Installing a package](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#installing-a-package)".

### Development setup

Use the package locally, first build the package by executing:

```shell
npm run build
```

On the `package.json` of your project, add the following:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "@zendesk/zaf-toolbox": "file:<path-to-repository>"
    }
}
```
